Airbnb Clone Project
Project Overview
This project aims to build an Airbnb-like platform allowing users to list, discover, and book properties worldwide. The primary goals are:
Implement a robust user management system (authentication, profiles, roles).


Develop property management (listings, images, amenities).


Create a booking system with availability checks and payment processing.


Integrate reviews and ratings for hosts and guests.


Ensure scalability, security, and maintainability using modern web technologies.


Tech Stack: Django, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions, Redis, React

Team Roles
Project Manager: Oversees project scope, timelines, and coordination among teams. Acts as primary liaison with stakeholders.


Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints, business logic, and integrates third-party services using Django and GraphQL.


Frontend Developer: Builds user interfaces with React, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.


Database Administrator (DBA): Designs schemas, optimizes queries, and manages PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity and performance.


DevOps Engineer: Configures CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, manages Docker containers, and monitors deployments.


QA Engineer: Writes and executes test plans, automates regression tests, and ensures application quality before releases.


Technology Stack
Technology
Purpose
Django
Web framework for building RESTful and GraphQL APIs
GraphQL
Flexible query language for client-server data interactions
PostgreSQL
Relational database for storing users, listings, bookings, etc.
React
Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces
Docker
Containerization for consistent development and production setup
GitHub Actions
CI/CD automation for testing, linting, and deployments
Redis
In-memory store for caching sessions and background tasks


Database Design
Entities and Key Fields
User: id, username, email, password_hash, role


Property: id, host_id (FK), title, description, location, price_per_night


Booking: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), start_date, end_date, status


Review: id, booking_id (FK), rating, comment, created_at


Payment: id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_method, status, timestamp


Relationships
A User can have multiple Properties (host relationship).


A Booking belongs to one User (guest) and one Property.


A Review is tied to a Booking and indirectly to both guest and host.


A Payment record corresponds to a Booking.


Feature Breakdown
User Management: Sign-up, login (JWT), profile editing, and role-based access control.


Property Management: CRUD operations for listings, image uploads, search filters, and map integration.


Booking System: Real-time availability checks, booking confirmation emails, and cancellation flows.


Payment Processing: Secure integration with payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal), transaction logging.


Reviews & Ratings: Guests submit reviews post-stay; hosts respond to feedback.


Notifications: Email/SMS notifications for booking events, payment receipts, and reminders.


API Security
Authentication: JWT tokens with expiration and refresh flows to secure endpoints.


Authorization: Role-based permissions (guest vs. host vs. admin) enforced at resolver level.


Input Validation: Strict schema validations in GraphQL to prevent injection attacks.


Rate Limiting: Throttle requests per IP to mitigate abuse and DoS attacks.


Data Encryption: HTTPS for data in transit, AES encryption for sensitive fields at rest.


CI/CD Pipeline
We will use GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments. Key steps:
Linting & Formatting: Run flake8 and black on each push.


Unit & Integration Tests: Execute Django and React test suites.


Docker Build: Build and tag images for backend and frontend.


Deploy to Staging: Push to AWS ECS or Kubernetes cluster.


Production Deployment: Manual approval step before rolling update.
