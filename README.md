Airbnb Clone Project

Project Overview

This project aims to build an Airbnb-like platform allowing users to list, discover, and book properties worldwide. 


A. The primary goals are:


    i. Implement a robust user management system.


    ii. Develop property management (listings, images, amenities).


    iii. Create a booking system with availability checks and payment processing.


    iv. Integrate reviews and ratings for hosts and guests.


    v. Ensure scalability, security, and maintainability using modern web technologies.


B. Tech Stack: Django, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Docker, GitHub Actions, Redis, React


C. Team Roles

    i. Project Manager: Oversees project scope, timelines, and coordination among teams. Acts as primary liaison with stakeholders.


    ii. Backend Developer: Implements API endpoints, business logic, and integrates third-party services using Django and GraphQL.


    iii. Frontend Developer: Builds user interfaces with React, ensuring responsiveness and accessibility.


    iv. Database Administrator (DBA): Designs schemas, optimizes queries, and manages PostgreSQL to ensure data integrity and performance.


    v. DevOps Engineer: Configures CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions, manages Docker containers, and monitors deployments.


    vi. QA Engineer: Writes and executes test plans, automates regression tests, and ensures application quality before releases.


D. Technology Stack

    i. Django - Web framework for building RESTful and GraphQL APIs
    ii. GraphQL- Flexible query language for client-server data interactions
    iii. PostgreSQL - Relational database for storing users, listings, bookings, etc.
    iv. React - Frontend library for building interactive user interfaces
    v. Docker -Containerization for consistent development and production setup
    vi. GitHub Actions - CI/CD automation for testing, linting, and deployments
    v. Redis - In-memory store for caching sessions and background tasks


E. Database Design

    i. User: id, username, email, password_hash, role

    ii. Property: id, host_id (FK), title, description, location, price_per_night

    iii. Booking: id, user_id (FK), property_id (FK), start_date, end_date, status

    iv. Review: id, booking_id (FK), rating, comment, created_at

    v. Payment: id, booking_id (FK), amount, payment_method, status, timestamp


Relationships
    i. A User can have multiple Properties (host relationship).


    ii. A Booking belongs to one User (guest) and one Property.


    iii. A Review is tied to a Booking and indirectly to both guest and host.


    iv. A Payment record corresponds to a Booking.


Feature Breakdown
User Management: Sign-up, login (JWT), profile editing, and role-based access control.


Property Management: CRUD operations for listings, image uploads, search filters, and map integration.


Booking System: Real-time availability checks, booking confirmation emails, and cancellation flows.


Payment Processing: Secure integration with payment gateway (Stripe/PayPal), transaction logging.


Reviews & Ratings: Guests submit reviews post-stay; hosts respond to feedback.


Notifications: Email/SMS notifications for booking events, payment receipts, and reminders.


API Security
Authentication: JWT tokens with expiration and refresh flows to secure endpoints.


Authorization: Role-based permissions (guest vs. host vs. admin) enforced at resolver level.


Input Validation: Strict schema validations in GraphQL to prevent injection attacks.


Rate Limiting: Throttle requests per IP to mitigate abuse and DoS attacks.


Data Encryption: HTTPS for data in transit, AES encryption for sensitive fields at rest.


CI/CD Pipeline
We will use GitHub Actions to automate builds, tests, and deployments. Key steps:
Linting & Formatting: Run flake8 and black on each push.


Unit & Integration Tests: Execute Django and React test suites.


Docker Build: Build and tag images for backend and frontend.


Deploy to Staging: Push to AWS ECS or Kubernetes cluster.


Production Deployment: Manual approval step before rolling update.
